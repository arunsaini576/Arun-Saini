## üîÑ Career Transformation

After a successful career in manufacturing as an engineer, I'm now focused on transforming my career into **Data Analysis**. I'm passionate about leveraging data to drive decision-making and improve business processes.

## üìÇ Projects

Here are some of the projects I've worked on:

- **[Project 1 Travel Aggregator Analysis](#)**:
- **Brief Description:**
This project focuses on analyzing booking and session data for a travel startup, "MyNextBooking," which aggregates prices from various travel platforms. The analysis aimed to extract insights into customer behavior, booking trends, and device usage to help optimize the platform. The project was conducted using Python and the Pandas library for data manipulation and analysis.

**Scenario:**
Travelling has significantly changed thanks to technology. In the earlier days, booking journeys was a hassle, requiring people to contact travel agents, get prices, and do a lot of paperwork. With the advent of online apps, booking tickets has become easier. However, comparing prices across multiple platforms remains a challenge.

**Project Overview:**
"MyNextBooking‚Äù is an Indian start-up that acts as an aggregator on top of existing platforms like Yatra, MMT, and Goibibo. It helps users compare prices for their upcoming journeys and redirects them to the desired platform after displaying the price. As a newly hired analyst with proficiency in Python, my role was to help perform an in-depth analysis of the collected data.

**Objective:**
- Analyze booking and session data to extract insights and answer specific business questions.

**Key Tasks:**
1. **Distinct Data Analysis:**
   - Find the number of distinct bookings, sessions, and searches from the given datasets.
2. **Session Analysis:**
   - Determine how many sessions have more than one booking.
3. **Weekly Booking Trends:**
   - Identify the days of the week with the highest number of bookings and visualize the distribution with a pie chart.
4. **Service Analysis:**
   - For each service name, calculate the total number of bookings and the total Gross Booking Value (INR).
5. **Customer Behavior Analysis:**
   - For customers with more than one booking, determine the most frequently booked route (from_city to to_city).
6. **Advance Booking Analysis:**
   - Identify the top 3 departure cities where customers mostly book in advance, with at least 5 departures from each city.
7. **Correlation Analysis:**
   - Plot a heatmap showing correlations between numerical columns in the bookings dataset and identify the pair with the maximum correlation.
8. **Device Usage Analysis:**
   - For each service, determine the most used device type for making bookings on the platform.
9. **Booking Trends:**
   - Plot quarterly trends for the number of bookings by each device type, showing time series for each year and quarter.
10. **Booking-to-Search Ratio Analysis (oBSR):**
    - Calculate the average oBSR for each month and each day of the week.
    - Plot a time series of oBSR for all given dates.

**Data Sources:**
- **Bookings.csv:** Includes details such as customer_id, booking_id, from_city, to_city, booking_time, device_type_used, INR_Amount, service_name, and more.
- **Sessions.csv:** Includes session_id, search_id, search_time, session_starting_time, and booking_id.

**Technologies Used:**
- **Python**: Primary programming language used for the project.
- **Pandas**: Used for data manipulation and analysis.
- **Matplotlib & Seaborn**: Used for data visualization.

**Outcome:**
- Successfully analyzed and visualized booking trends, customer behavior, and device usage.
- Provided actionable insights for the business to optimize their booking platform.
